Before stepping through any door, a body'd better have a quick lesson in
cosmology - how else is a basher going to know where and what things are? First, it's
important to know just what a plane is. To the serious philosopher types, a plane's a world,
or a collection of worlds, that operates according to its own particular laws, including
those affecting magic, gravity, and even the morals of the place. On some of these
planes, the laws of "up" and "down" aren't the same; on others, evocation
magic yields different results; and elsewhere, behaving even slightly out of
line with the powers of the place makes for grim results.

Planes are either immense and infinite, in which case they're just
called planes, or they're limited by definite borders and are called
demiplanes. The exact number of planes is unknown and
probably infinite, and planar travelers know of only three
main categories: the Prime Material Plane, the Inner
Planes, and the Outer Planes. Still, those three
have more than enough space for a flaming
large number of different planes.
To get around in the planar multiverse,
there are three basic rules to remember:
• The Center of the Multiverse
• The Unity of Rings
-••The Rule of Threes
These truths pretty well describe
the structure of all the universes, so
learn them well!
